                |  JIRAPassword (string)  	|  (Optional) If a username was specified and a password is not the user will be prompted for password at runtime 					|

            This must be called first to be able to do most JIRA actions such as creating a new issue and assigning users.
            When connecting to JIRA you may need to authenticate a user. This can be done by passing in Username and Password as parameters. However, should you wish to not have a sensitive password saved in a file,  an option is available to not pass in a Password and a prompt will appear asking for the JIRA password at runtime.


            'connect to jira' can be called on its own and will default options to:
                '{'rest_api_version': '2', 'verify': True,
                'server': 'http://localhost:2990/jira', 'headers': {'X-Atlassian-Token': 'nocheck'},
                'rest_path': 'api', 'resilient': False, 'async': False}'
            These can all be customised as needed.

            Will create a new issue and returns an Issue Key.
            The user will use the issue_field_dict variable to specify the issues field and their respective values. This must be in the form of a string written as a dictionary
                e.g. {'FieldName':'FieldValue'}

            The field value can also be another dictionary (in some field cases this is needed)

            This Create Issue Example page (https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+API+Example+-+Create+Issue) is full of useful information in what is required for creating issues, including customfields and issue field value types, it is very important to get the value type right or an error will be thrown.
